# PlayClips Sample cocos2d-x

[PlayClips](https://www.playcom.com/playclips/index.html) integration sample
implemented with cocos2d-x framework, using [Adjust](https://www.adjust.com)
as attribution platform.

Please check [PlayClips developer documentation site](https://developer.playclips.com/)
for detailed explanation about [PlayClips](https://www.playcom.com/playclips/index.html).

Funcionalities covered in this project:

* How to [integrate Adjust SDK](https://github.com/adjust/cocos2dx_sdk).
* How to obtain information via [Adjust deferred deeplink](https://docs.adjust.com/en/deeplinking/#deferred-deeplinking). Specifically, how to obtain the influencer that should be
associated to the user.
* How to download an influencer asset catalog using [Cocos2d-x Asset
Manager](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/wiki/Assets_Manager_Extension).
* How to play a video using [Cocos2d-x
VideoPlayer](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/reference/native-cpp/V3.11/d5/d18/classcocos2d_1_1experimental_1_1ui_1_1_video_player.html)

# Setup environment

## Clone repository
This repository does not hold the cocos2d-x framework, which is linked using a
[git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) to prevent a
considerable growth in the repository size. For that reason, while cloning the
repository you need to include the `--recursive` flag (to initialize the
submodule while cloning the repo).

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:weareplaycom/playclips-sample-cocos2d-x.git
```

## Download external dependencies

After cloning the repository, you need to download cocos2d-x dependencies using
the following script provided by cocos2d-x framework:

```bash
# NOTE: it requires python2.x
python cocos2d/download-deps.py
```

Now you can open the Xcode project included in the repository.

## Project configuration

The project configuration is included in the header file `PlayClipsSampleConfig.h`.

* **AdjustEnvironment**: either sandbox (AdjustEnvironmentSandbox2dx) or production
  environment (AdjustEnvironmentProduction2dx).
* **AdjustAppToken**: a valid token, as defined in [your Adjust
  dashboard](https://www.adjust.com/). You can use [keyword
  expansion](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes) to
  [prevent having local changes in your
  folder](http://www.juandebravo.com/2017/12/02/git-filter-smudge-and-clean).
  Being YOUR-REAL-TOKEN the token you have obtained from Adjust console, execute the following:

  ```bash
  git config --global filter.adjustAppToken.smudge 'sed "s/{your-app-token}/YOUR-REAL-TOKEN/"'
  git config --global filter.adjustAppToken.clean 'sed "s/YOUR-REAL-TOKEN/{your-app-token}/"'
  ```

* **AdjustLogLevel**: configure [one of the values listed in Adjust
  documentation](https://github.com/adjust/cocos2dx_sdk/blob/master/doc/ios/ios.md#sdk-logging).

## Adjust configuration (campaign and deferred deeplink)

* Create an application (or use an existing one).
* Configure the platforms you'd like to test:
  * iOS: configure the Universal Link information:
    * app prefix: as defined in [Apple developer web site](https://developer.apple.com/account)
    * app scheme: as defined in the [Info.plist](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/Inter-AppCommunication/Inter-AppCommunication.html) file.
    * Short Universal Link: this is auto-generated by Adjust.
  * Android: configure a valid appId
* Generate a tracker in Adjust, associated to PlayClips network.
* Send the tracker to your PlayClips contact point.

## Tips

* If you want to prevent the video player controls to appear, follow
[the suggestion in this link](http://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/disable-videoplayer-controls-while-playing/32760/3).
